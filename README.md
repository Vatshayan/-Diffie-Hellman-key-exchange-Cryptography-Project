Communication security Project involving ciphers and  Diffie Hellman key exchange Algorithms

The Diffieâ€“Hellman Key Exchange Method (hereafter called the D-H method) allows two parties agree upon a shared secret number, a symmetric key, over an insecure communications channel/medium, where attackers/hackers might be listening in. The benefit of using a symmetric key over public key cryptography lies in the fact that encryption of a plaintext message into a ciphertext message and decryption of the ciphertext message back to the original plaintext message happens much faster using a symmetric key.
